Take a look below to sentences:\n1) Rahul is absent because Rahul is ill. (\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u0905\u0928\u0941\u092a\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902\u0915\u093f \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u092c\u0940\u092e\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u0948\u0964 )\n2) Rahul is absent because he is ill.
