At least 10 million Gandhi(s) are needed to solve the problems faced by the billion of\u00a0us.*\n\n\nEducation isn't just equipping students with the hard skills like Software Engineering, but also exposing them to experiences that facilitate a strong connection between themselves and the community. Alignment with one's own self is critical for achieving harmony with one's environment. Such experiences help to nurture an understanding of our own selves and be more aware.\n\n\nThere are various such opportunities to learn within the campus, during the year itself. **However, we realized that we can never cover the diversified range of experiences with high intensity and depth that the ecosystem around has to offer to effectively help the you**. To ensure that you can learn from such a vibrant ecosystem, we launched a program called \"**Manthan**\". Under Manthan, we have partnered with organizations who provide a range of experiences and also ensure a dialogue with you on the questions persistent in you.\n\n**Manthan** will give you a strong and personalized exposure to several ideas out there that would facilitate your shaping into **a more aware person**. It not only puts you on a journey to **explore more** and get deeply connected to your own roots but also prepare you better **to respond to the unique challenges that are posed by workplaces today**.\n\n", "sequenceNum": 1000, "parentExerciseId": null, "slug": "manthan__introduction"}
