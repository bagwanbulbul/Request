It is the duty of the respective council members to address any such issue raised within three days.\n\nIn order to ensure quick resolution of campus affairs, the DISCO will take stock of all unresolved complaints on a weekly basis.\n\nAny complaint against one or more members of the DISCO will be addressed by the Board of Governors. \n \nIf a disciplinary action is taken against a member of the Council, the member will be up for review by the Board of Governors.\n\n\n\n", "sequenceNum": 5000, "parentExerciseId": null, "slug": "constitution__section-3-complaints"}
